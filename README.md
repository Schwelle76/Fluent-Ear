# Fluent Ear  
*Play what you hear. Play what you imagine.*  


**Fluent Ear** is an ear training web app for musicians that takes input directly from your instrument through the microphone.  
Instead of clicking UI buttons, you play the requested note or interval on your instrument — training your ability to play what you hear and thus play what you imagine just like speaking a language fluently.

## Features
- **Ear training** – learn to detect musical intervals and play them right away
- **Microphone input** – practice on your instrument using the microphone of your device
- **Customizable training** – choose your own intervals, scales, and root notes as well as the direction of the intervals
- **Responsive & lightweight** – runs directly in your browser, no installation needed
